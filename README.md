[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installation on a Google Nexus 7 tablet.

## Background
I print out a hard copy of the New York Times crossword puzzle quite regularly. Realizing that the steps to navigate to the puzzle and print it out were the same each time, my first thought was to to create an automation with Google Assistant and IFTTT. Unfortunately, the process is too complex for those tools: the URL of the crossword changes each day, the puzzle needs to be downloaded from that URL, then the downloaded puzzle needs to be sent to my printer.

Further research pointed me toward [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), which has all the tools needed for this task. In addition, Home Assistant is extensible: it requires much more setup than IFTTT, but once set up, it is ready for all sorts of automations which I haven't even thought of yet.

The Home Assistant installation guide recommends using a Raspberry Pi to run the automation server. I had a Google Nexus 7 tablet lying around, so I set out to make use of it instead of buying a new device. An additional benefit is that the tablet can be used as a wall-mounted UI for Home Assistant - this is something you can do regardless of where the Home Assistant server is hosted, but this setup allows the server and UI to be run on one device.

## Prerequisites
- hardware: Google Nexus 7 (2013) tablet
- software: Android 5.0.0
- peripherals: a Google Home Mini, and a smart plug (peripherals are not required for Home Assistant setup, but most automations you'll want to create will require a peripheral)
